# wacky-weighted-wheel

## Side Project 1: Goals Outlined

Wheel spinner (piechart that spins until it eventually lands on an option)

Should pop up a box for which category it landed on

User is able to put in categories, weights of the categories (colors if you wanna get fancy)

weights will normalize on the off chance the user goes above or below 100%

Options for category to delete when it is landed on (and the wheel renormalizes), grey out the category (but not remove from view), or keep when landed on

Button to reset all categories on the wheel

Might be nice to be able to save your wheel inputs (many possible ways to do this and then reimport them later) 

Might be fun to add icon options and themes
